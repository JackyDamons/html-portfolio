<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jacky Damons and I live in Cape Town, South Africa. I have been a Business Analyst for more than 7 years.</p>
<p>I have recently decided to learn to code and have started my journey through Angela Yu's course.</p> 
<p>I've always been a creative soul. Web development gives me a much needed creative outlet while still utilizing some of my past experiences working on system improvement projects. I cannot wait to see where this journey leads.</p>
